This is an example project using  C++ and OpenGL to generate voxel in a 32 * 32 * 32 chunk of a "world".
i've done most of the work on this project "offline" and while it may seem that all the files are added within very few commits to get to the current point it took a while.
this is an attempt of mine to also program shaders
